Scala 3 has been carefully designed to improve
the backward and forward compatibility
of the Scala programming language.

Scala 3 provides a toolbox full of metaprogramming features,
which are safer, more robust, and much more stable than their
counterparts in Scala 2.

Implementing macro libraries in Scala 3 is simpler and the resulting libraries
are easier to maintain across future versions of Scala.
The improvements come at a price: the metaprogramming facilities have been
re-designed from the ground up.

In consequence, existing macro libraries need to be ported to the new interfaces.
